# What it means
Diversity: The **practice or quality** of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.

Inclusion: The **practice or policy** of providing equal access to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized, such as those who have physical or mental disabilities and members of other minority groups.

# Why it is important
Today's workforce is organically diversifying the variety of talent to choose from as an organization.
- not taking advantage of this is a miss.

Innovation benefits
- Those with differing backgrounds have different views, methodologies, and workflows that could benefit a project business goal.

Perception of modern org.
 - Highly skilled resources are attracted to the types of companies that have a diversified workforce.

Social Diversity benefits the community of business.
- spreading the wealth and opportunities
- people living together and work together and sharing culture and experiences (breaking down walls)
- Increasing interactions between groups that may not otherwise cross and hopefully spreads outside of work



# Understanding why it is a difficult problem
Lack or late recognition of the systemic issue.
- acting late puts your company behind the competition in any facet of business.
- Not realizing you have and issue means you cannot act on it, putting you further behind you competition.

Actions without follow-through are detrimental.

Those with power to act on issues are usually part of the uniform group to begin with.
