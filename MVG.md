# Mission
- we are an open source project that focuses on diversity and inclusion
- we wanted to allow everyone, at all levels, to contribute in creating a framework that promotes diversity
- we hope to make a significant impact on the organizations that can not support an entire diversity section and possibly create a baseline approach

# Goals

Socialize our efforts to the technical community at large.
Create a continuous feedback loop to improve means, methods and techniques.
Provide a method for all to contribute to diversity and inclusion efforts
