# Mission and Vision
The mission of this project is to help increase diversity and inclusion (D&I) in the workplace using the open-source approach. We hope to deliver a framework that can be used by all organizations that want to implement, improve or validate their D&I efforts. We will leverage the entire community's knowledge and experience to build and test the framework that we propose. The open-source approach we will provide everyone better visibility of D&I efforts within organizations using our framework

Our vision is to provide organizations a gold standard on how to successfully implement and maintain a diverse culture and workplace. We hope to fill a knowledge gap in small organizations that do not have the means to stand-up their own D&I infrastructure. For medium and large organizations, they can use our framework to validate and possibly improve their D&I implementations. Our team will engage with these organizations, gather results from their efforts, and then integrate those results into the next iteration. We will maintain a continuous feedback loop that incorporates those deliverables as well as inputs from non-organizational engagement. 

# Our Goals are:
- Develop documentation that can be used for the creation, maintenance and validation of D&I sub-organizations.
- Socialize our efforts to the technical community at large.
- Create a continuous feedback loop to improve means, methods and techniques.
- Provide a method(s) for all to contribute to D&I efforts.
