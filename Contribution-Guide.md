# Becoming a contributor
As we work primarily in github you will find a list of areas that require attention in the issues section of repo. The core team will take ownership of these issues but anyone is able to submit a pull request to close an issue.

# Before contributing
Please review the code of conduct to ensure that any work and communication follow our policies.

If you plan to contribute core content on diversity and inclusion please read the document or section to get a sense of the flow and tone. Please do your best to maintain that in your contribution.

Do not submit again that you do not own or is not available to use freely.

Also review the repo's issues for possible areas to contibute.
