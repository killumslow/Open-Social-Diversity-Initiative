# Open Social Diversity Initiative

## What we are trying to accomplish
- we are an open source project that focuses on diversity and inclusion
- we wanted to allow everyone, at all levels, to contribute in creating a framework that promotes diversity
- we hope to make a significant impact on the organizations that can not support an entire diversity section and possibly create a baseline approach


Our main focus is to make a reusable general purpose framework used to implement or validate D&I efforts. Examples of focus areas will be recruitment, retention, promotion, reporting, and education.

We hope to get feedback from the community on how we can improve the framework.
